# Project: WeLoveMovies

  Engineered a database and RESTful API with CRUD operations allowing users to access data about the latest movies, theaters, and reviews.
  This is a full-stack javascript application, built in a 3 tier architecture, with a PostgreSQL database, Express server, and React front end. All CRUD operations can be done for review resources.

## Technologies used:

    • The front end was designed with React, HTML, and Bootstrap 4. 
    • The backend consists of an Express.js server hosted on Heroku and a PostgreSQL database.
    
## Learning objectives:

  This project is designed to test the ability to build complex servers and access data through a database.

    • Install and use common middleware packages
    • Receive requests through routes
    • Run tests from the command line
    • Access relevant information through route and query parameters
    • Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist
    • Build an API following RESTful design principles
    • Create and customize a knexfile.js file
    • Create a connection to the database with Knex
    • Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
    • Return joined and nested data with Knex
    • Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
    • Deploy your backend server to a cloud service
